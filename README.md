This is a preference pack including GUI color information to extend the Behave Dark stylesheet.

The [Behave Dark](https://github.com/Chrismettal/FreeCAD-Behave-dark) stylesheet is distributed with FreeCAD directly and does not need to be installed manually.

Currently, the colors are extended to the output window, editor, PartDesign and Sketcher workbenches. Other workbenches will be done.

## Installation

Using [Preference Packs](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Preference_Packs) requires FreeCAD 0.20 or higher.

Preference Packs should be installed via the [Addon Manager](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons), but can be [installed manually](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Preference_Packs#Distributing_a_pack) if required.
